### Explanation of Design Choices

1. **Users Table**:
    - **UserID**: An auto-incremented primary key to uniquely identify each user.
    - **Username**: A unique username for each user to facilitate login and user identification.
    - **Email**: A unique email address for each user for contact and recovery purposes.
    - **PasswordHash**: A hashed version of the user's password for secure storage.
    - **CreatedAt**: A timestamp to record when the user account was created.

2. **Products Table**:
    - **ProductID**: An auto-incremented primary key to uniquely identify each product.
    - **UserID**: A foreign key referencing the UserID in the Users table, establishing the relationship that each product is listed by a specific user.
    - **ProductName**: The name of the product.
    - **ProductDescription**: A text field to provide detailed information about the product.
    - **Price**: A decimal field to store the product price, with precision for currency values.
    - **CreatedAt**: A timestamp to record when the product was listed.

### Relationships and Constraints

- The `UserID` field in the `Products` table is a foreign key that references the `UserID` in the `Users` table. This establishes a one-to-many relationship, where a single user can list multiple products.
- The `ON DELETE CASCADE` clause ensures that if a user is deleted, all products listed by that user are also deleted, maintaining referential integrity.

### Additional Considerations

- **Password Security**: Passwords are stored as hashes rather than plain text for security reasons. This is crucial to protect user data in case of a database breach.
- **Indexes**: Unique constraints on `Username` and `Email` ensure that these fields are indexed, which improves query performance and enforces data integrity.
- **Timestamps**: The `CreatedAt` fields automatically record the creation time of records, which can be useful for auditing and data analysis.
